# 🎣 Phishing Website Simulation Tool (Educational Purpose Only)

This project is a **Phishing Website Simulation Tool** built for demonstrating how phishing attacks work in a **controlled, ethical, and educational environment**. It helps learners understand the risks, techniques, and countermeasures related to phishing.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

> 🚨 This tool is intended **strictly for educational purposes only**.  
> ❌ Do **NOT** use this tool on real targets or without explicit permission.  
> ⚖️ Unauthorized use of phishing techniques is **illegal** and violates ethical hacking guidelines.

## 🎯 Objective

To simulate a phishing website that mimics a real login page, collects credentials (to a local file or terminal), and demonstrates how social engineering is used in cyberattacks — for **awareness and training purposes only**.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 💻 Clones a basic login page (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- 📝 Captures and logs entered usernames and passwords locally
- ⚠️ Displays a fake error message or redirect to the real website
- 📂 Logs data to a text file for demo purposes
- ✅ Easy to host using Python or local web servers

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS (Frontend design)
- PHP or Python (For form handling)
- Optional: Ngrok (For exposing localhost)

---
Start a local web server (for example, using PHP):

Open the site in your browser:
http://localhost:8080
You can use Ngrok to expose it externally for testing in isolated environments:

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Understand how phishing pages are created
Recognize social engineering tactics used in phishing
Learn how to identify and defend against phishing attacks
Realize the importance of email & URL verification, 2FA, and user training

🛡️ Ethical Use Only
This project is not meant to be deployed publicly or used to trick others.
It is a training resource to build awareness and defensive strategies in cybersecurity environments such as:
Ethical hacking labs
Security awareness training
Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions
Red team/blue team simulations
